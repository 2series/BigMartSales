About this Analysis:

**Sales prediction** is a very common real-life problem that each company faces at least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can have a significant impact on the success and performance of that company.

In this analysis I will be working on the [Big Mart Sales Prediction Challenge.](https://trainings.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/course-v1:AnalyticsVidhya+BigMS01+2018_1/about) It explores which locations produce the most sales. It also explores characteristics of these locations such as Outlet Type and Outlet Size. In the end, a prediction model is be built in order to predict the sales of each item at each outlet.

The analysis equip one with the skills and techniques required to solve regression problems in R. You are provided with sufficient theory and practice material to hone your predictive modeling skills.
